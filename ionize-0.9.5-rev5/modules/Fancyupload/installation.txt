The FancyUpload module gives your user the ability to upload files to your server, in a given folder.
You can define which group of users have the right to upload.
Used in combination with the login tags, it gives you a powerful and easy way to provide an upload function to your website.



Installation
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

1.Go to Modules > Administration
2.Click on the right link : “Install”



Configuration
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

The admin configuration panel is quite simple :

1. Select the destination folder (which must be in your base files folder), 
2. Select the max file size(should be <= to the max upload size allowed by the server),
3. Add or not a prefix to each uploaded file (the prefix will be the username of the user who do the upload)
4. Set the authorized group

When setting up the “Alert to admin”, an email will be sent to the given address after each users upload.
When setup the authorized group, the group of the uploading user is checked before the uploads starts. If the user has not the required level, the upload fails.



How to display the upload form ?
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

To display the FancyUpload upload form, just add the tag <ion:fancyupload /> in one of your view :

	<div class="article"> 
		<!-- Article's content (title and text) -->
		<ion:title tag="h2" /> 
		<ion:content />
	
		<!-- Max upload information get from module config file -->
		<p><ion:translation term="module_fancyupload_max_upload_size" /> : <span><ion:config item="fancyupload_max_upload" /> Mo</span></p> 
		
		<!-- Module's upload form -->
		<ion:fancyupload /> 
	</div>

Important : After creating your upload view, you'll need to declare the view in order to link it to an article in Ionize.


Restrict access to users
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

The idea : 	Make the upload page only visible for logged users.
Why : 		To avoid spam bot form send.
How : 		By restricting access to the upload form to logged users.

Even the module checks if the user has the right to upload, the upload form stays visible for all users.
It could be nice to hide the page containing the upload module and to show it only to the connected users. 
Have a look at the Login tag for more information about this functionality.

1. Restrict upload page access to one users group.
   In the page, limit the authorization to the “Users” group :

2. In the header view (for example) used in your pages, add the following lines : 
   
   <ion:login form_view="access/login_form" logged_view="access/login_info" /> 

3. When the user is not connected, the above tag will output the view located in : /themes/<your_theme>/views/access/login_form.
   When connected, it will outputs the view located in /themes/<your_theme>/views/access/login_info.
   Once he is logged on, the user will see the upload menu item and have access to the upload page.
